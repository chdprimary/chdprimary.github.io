			<h2>The What</h2>
			<p>
				While I was a student worker on a 'keyboard authentication' project between Louisiana Tech University and DARPA, my main task was to design, build, and maintain a testing interface web 
				application for the project. I had no experience in web development, ASP.NET, C#, jQuery, or AJAX, but I learned everything from scratch quickly as I developed the site.
			<p>
			<h2>The Why</h2>
			<p>
				As the system's code base was being built and academic papers were being written, regression and performance analysis tests were being run almost constantly. My site allowed a user
				to enqueue these tests (by configuring various parameters), check their status, view their conclusive data upon finishing or failing, and export this data to CSV. This site provided 
				a public interface to non-technical decision-makers who otherwise would have no way to interact with the system. This site, at it's highest capacity, gave access to the data of several
				hundred system tests.
			</p>
			<h2>The How</h2>
			<p>
				I started with the 'Create Test' functionality. I created a sectioned HTML form where each section of fields was disabled until the preceding section's fields had been filled. 
				When this form was finally submitted with all test parameters and metadata, the data was serialized and jQuery AJAX'd to a WebMethod on the backend, which gathered the data into a
				DataTable. This DataTable was then passed as a set of parameters a TSQL stored procedure, which transferred the data to our SQL Server database. Upon completion, the user was
				notified of the success via an on-page modal.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was given new features to implement as time passed, such as the ability to monitor a test's status, view a test's results, and perform analysis tests by choosing particular
				combinations of typing features to feed to the system. For the Test Status and Test Results pages I had to figure out how to programmatically create HTML tables as data was returned
				from stored procedures. For the Analysis page I wrote code to populate a 'checkbox matrix' of features from test data contained in our database. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I refactored my jQuery code a couple times as I gained knowledge and experience with the library, and saw significant performance and readability increases. I styled the entire app 
				by building custom CSS here and there on top of the '<a href="https://bootswatch.com/flatly/">Flatly</a>' Bootstrap theme. It's also worth noting that the website is fully responsive
				and mobile-friendly, as shown in the video above.
