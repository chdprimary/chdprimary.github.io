			<h2>The What and The Why</h2>
			<p>
				While I was a student worker on a 'keyboard authentication' project between Louisiana Tech University and DARPA, my main task was to design, build, and maintain a testing interface for
				the project. As the system's code base was being built and academic papers were being written, regression tests on the system were being run almost constantly. My site allowed a user
				to enqueue these tests (by configuring various parameters), check their status, view their conclusive data upon finishing or failing, and export this data to CSV. This site provided 
				a public interface to non-technical decision-makers who otherwise would have no way to interact with the system. This site, at it's highest capacity, gave access to the data of several
				hundred system tests.
