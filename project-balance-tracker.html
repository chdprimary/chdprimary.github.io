			<h2>The Setup</h2>
			<p>
				In June 2015 I decided that I'd like to experiment a bit with AWS. I decided to create a page featuring an automatically-updating chart of my personal checking account balance. 
			</p>
			<h2>The Plan</h2>
			<p>
				Since my bank information is hosted on <a href="https://www.mint.com">mint.com</a>, I did some digging and found an open-source mint.com API called <a href="https://github.com/dhleong/pepper-mint">pepper-mint</a> which I could use 
				to scrape my bank balance. I first scanned through the API to ensure there was no way it could phone home with my mint.com password hard-coded in. Although there was some documentation 
				provided for this API, information on how to access an account's balance was missing. It took a small amount of reverse-engineering, but I managed to figure out the proper terminology for 
				returning my account balance anyway. I ran pepper-mint, and it successfully returned my balance.
			</p>
			<p>
				I then read a bit about AWS and surmised I'd need to create an <em>EC2</em> instance. I did so, using a Bitnami MEAN image to accomplish a fast stand-up. I scp'd pepper-mint to the EC2 instance,
				and built my own JS script on top of it which would format &amp; append the current date and current bank balance to a persistent CSV file. This script was made to run every 3 days using
				the open-source <a href="https://github.com/tejasmanohar/node-schedule">node-schedule</a>, which is basically the traditional cron functionality wrapped up in a JavaScript library. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The last step was short &ndash; I just created a simple page, which used jQuery and HighCharts to create an animated line graph of the data stored in the CSV file.
