				<h2>The Setup</h2>
				<p>
					<b>In June 2015 I decided</b> that I'd like to experiment a bit with AWS. I decided to create a page featuring an automatically-updating chart of my personal checking account balance. 
				</p>
				<h2>The Plan</h2>
				<p>
					Since my bank information is hosted on mint.com, I did some digging and found an open-source mint.com API called pepper-mint (https://github.com/dhleong/pepper-mint) which I could use 
					to scrape my bank balance. I first scanned through the API to ensure there was no way it could phone home with my mint.com password hard-coded in. Although there was some documentation 
					provided for this API, information on how to access an account's balance was missing. It took a small amount of reverse-engineering, but I managed to figure out the proper terminology for 
					returning my account balance anyway. I ran pepper-mint, and it successfully returned my balance.
				</p>
				<p>
					I then read a bit about AWS and surmised I'd need to create an EC2 instance. I did so, using a Bitnami MEAN image to accomplish a fast stand-up. I scp'd pepper-mint to the EC2 instance,
					and built my own JS script on top of it which would format &amp; append the current date and current bank balance to a persistent CSV file. This script was made to run every 3 days using
					the open-source node-schedule (https://github.com/tejasmanohar/node-schedule), which is basically the traditional cron functionality wrapped up in a JavaScript library. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The last step was short &ndash; I just created a simple page, which used jQuery and HighCharts to create an animated line graph of the data stored in the CSV file. 
				</p>
				<h2>The Tools</h2>
				<p>AWS EC2 &#8226; MEAN &#8226; Highcharts &#8226; Cron (node-schedule) &#8226; Mint.com API (pepper-mint) &#8226; Linux commands (ssh, scp, nano)</p>
